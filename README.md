## Project Overview

[Add a brief overview of the project and its main goals here.]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run and interact with the smart contracts in this project, you'll need the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version X.X.X)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version X.X.X)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) (version X.X.X) - A development framework for Ethereum.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-solidity-project.git
cd your-solidity-project
```

2. Install the required Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile the smart contracts using Truffle:

```bash
truffle compile
```

4. [Add any additional setup steps, if necessary.]

## Project Structure
